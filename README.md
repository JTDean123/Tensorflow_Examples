neural netowork examples in Tensorflow


I like Tensorflow because I feel it forces me to understand on a deeper level exactly what each layer and function in a neural netowork is doing to transform features.  I recently built some simple feed forward, recurrent, and stacked LSTM neural networks in Tensorflow and trained them on the ubiquitous IRIS and MNIST data sets to establish frameworks that I can build on for more complicated projects in the future
